# Predicting-testscore-with-supervised-learning
In this regression project we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. 
we will make prediction for scores percentage for the hours of reading, compare the predicted result with the actual result and final evaluate the performance of our regression model
